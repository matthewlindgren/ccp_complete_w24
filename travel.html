          <h3>About Chiang Mai</h3>
          <p>
            Chiang Mai, nestled in the lush hills of northern Thailand, is a
            city that captivates with its unique blend of cultural richness and
            natural beauty. Situated approximately 700 kilometers north of
            Bangkok, Chiang Mai is the largest city in the region and serves as
            the capital of the province of the same name. Its geographical
            location is nothing short of enchanting, surrounded by forested
            mountains and picturesque landscapes. This charming city, often
            referred to as the "Rose of the North," offers visitors a delightful
            escape from the bustling urban life, inviting them to explore a
            realm where tradition meets modernity amidst a backdrop of stunning
            scenery.<br><br>
            The heart of Chiang Mai beats with a rich history that dates back
            over 700 years. Founded in 1296, the city was originally the capital
            of the ancient Lanna Kingdom. Today, remnants of its storied past
            are scattered throughout the city, from the ancient temples that dot
            the landscape to the preserved city walls and moats that harken back
            to a bygone era. Among the city's treasures is the revered Wat Phra
            Singh, a 14th-century temple known for its intricate architecture
            and revered Buddha image. Chiang Mai's historical sites provide a
            captivating glimpse into its heritage, making it a destination that
            seamlessly weaves together the past and present for visitors to
            explore and appreciate

          <h3>About Hawaii</h3>
          <p>
            Welcome to Hawaii, the Aloha state. Hawaii is comprised of a chain
            of 132 islands. We usually think of the eight main islands when we
            think of Hawaii. This is not surprising as the other 124 islands
            only total about 3 square miles in land area.<br><br>
            Hawaii is home of the world's most active volcano, the crater of
            Kilauea on Mauna Loa. Sandy beaches, towering volcanoes, and lush
            valleys lure thousands of tourists each year to this tropical
            paradise.

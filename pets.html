          <p>
            Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
            lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
            gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
            as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
            avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
            skills in chasing them. <br><br>At night just as the rest of the
            family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
            energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag
            the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of
            rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.

            Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was
            found wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where
            he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a
            special personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He
            spends most of his time staring out the window to keep watch of his
            house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his
            family from the mailman and squirrels every single day.<br><br>
            Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have
            fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes
            he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves
            his toy duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to
            hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.

        <h2>Juno</h2>

         >
          <p>
            No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the
            more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite
            this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the
            same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered
            age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages
            to stay in good spirits.<br><br>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes
            is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making
            sure every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling
            around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno would have been the one
            that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.
